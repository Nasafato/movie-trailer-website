The code is very simple:

Running "python entertainment_center.py" creates the website, which is fresh_tomatoes.html.

entertainment_center imports fresh_tomatoes.py and media.py.
media.py contains the Movie class, which has fields for movie title, movie Youtube trailer url, and movie poster image url.
entertainment_center creates the 6 movies I manually input into the code and puts them into a list, which it then passes to
the function open_movies_page(), which is found in fresh_tomatoes.py
